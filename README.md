My Learning Task 1: Personal Website. (Please view the code of the README.md to see the answers to the guided questions)

<!-- How your website accomplished each item in the criteria.
-> The website accomplished the use of HTML tags through proper structuring of the document, employed various CSS selectors for styling, utilized a mix of CSS styles for visual appeal, incorporated Flexbox for layout management, ensured responsiveness with media queries, and included subtle animations on project images.


Where could the concepts discussed in class be seen in your website?
-> HTML tags such as <div>, <p>, <ul>, and others are used for content structuring, while CSS concepts like selectors (class, ID), styles (color, font-size), Flexbox, and media queries are applied throughout the website for styling and layout. All of these were discussed in our class, and it proved to be useful in making the website that I made.


What was your inspiration for the design of the website?
-> The inspiration for my website design is for it to have a clean and modern aesthetic, combining Playfair Display and Karla fonts, along with a coffee color palette (coffee is one of my favorite drinks), creating a professional and visually appealing look


What was your approach in creating the content of the website?
-> My approach in creating the content of the website was to give personal information about myself, so the viewer and visitors of my website would get to know a bit more about me. I have included personal things in the website, such as my interests, while also including the professional things about myself such as my skills and the projects that I have worked on.


How is your website creative?
-> My website is creative because this website is about my personal self, and it is made based off of my personal taste. One example of this is the use of a coffee colored palette, this was done because of the personal attachment I have to coffee, and because I love the color of coffee.


What did you use to deploy your website?
-> To deploy my website, I used GitHub pages. GitHub Pages is a web hosting service provided by GitHub that allows users to deploy and showcase static websites directly from their GitHub repositories, making it easy to share and publish web content.


Insights that you have gathered while accomplishing LT0, LT1, and M1M2 (Guided Exercise 1)
-> There are a lot of CSS designs we can use to make our website look even more organized. We can utilize things such as flexbox to make our layout look a lot cleaner, animations and transitions to make our website look even more interesting and interactive. We can also change the colors, and fonts that we use to contribute to a visually appealing and user-friendly design on our website.


Struggles that you have encountered while accomplishing LT0, LT1, and M1M2 (Guided Exercise 1)
-> Personally, I feel like I did not encounter much struggles while I was accomplishing LT0, LT1, and M1M2. This was because my professor helped guide me, and I also had my classmates to ask for help if ever I did not immediately get how to do something. If I had to give one though, I would have to say the one struggle I had was HTML and CSS are very new to me, and this is the first time I have tried using it to code. Thankfully, it wasn't a major struggle because of the guidance I have received.


How you could improve your website in the future
-> To improve my website, I could use some javascript to improve the interactivity of my website. It will optimize the images for faster loading, make the animations feel a lot more smoother, and it can add a smooth scroll effect for better navigation.


Other thoughts that might be noteworthy
-> I had a lot of fun with this activity, I feel as if I have used the content and concepts that was taught to me very well, and it was reflected in the website that was made. I also learned a lot with the given guided links, and I am very satisfied on what the website has turned out to be.
